Observation 1:
- Customers are more interested in tracking their carbon footprint than not buying certain unsustainable products.
- In our survey, users consistently voted more in favor of the 'reducing waste' options than the product-related options.
- We plan on pivoting our idea more towards the carbon footprint calculator and goal setting.

Observation 2:
- Customers are interested in comparing their progress to others.
- In our survey, there were multiple users that suggested comparing their sustainability progress to other users.
- We plan on adding in a functionality to compare the results of one's carbon footprint calculator to other users' who have made theirs public.

Observation 3:
- Users are indifferent about using an app to track sustainability unless it is easy to use.
- In our survey users consistently voted that they were concerned with their environmental impact but only slightly more likely to use an app for tracking purposes.
- We plan to use a barcode scanner and auto-saving items to reduce the amount of input required from the user.
