# GreenWay Code of Conduct

# Our Pledge
We, as members of this team, pledge to create a respectful and collaborative environment that fosters 
inclusivity and accountability. We are committed to upholding our shared values and ensuring that participation 
in our community is a positive experience for everyone, regardless of background or perspective.


# Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive team environment include:

Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward team members.
Respecting differing opinions and experiences.
Providing and graciously accepting constructive feedback.
Taking responsibility for our actions and learning from mistakes.
Focusing on what is best for the team as a whole.
Open communication and full participation from all members.
Arriving on time to all meetings.


Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

Distracted use of technology (e.g., phones away) during team meetings.
Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments.
Public or private harassment.
Sharing others' private information without consent.
Other conduct that could be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

# Decision Making
Decisions will be made by majority vote unless a consensus is required. Each 
member will have a voice in discussions, and we will strive for alignment before 
finalizing decisions.

# Attendance
We expect regular attendance at all team meetings. Legitimate reasons for missing 
a meeting include illness, emergencies, or academic commitments. Members who miss 
meetings should catch up on missed discussions and tasks through shared notes and 
communicate with the team about their absence.

# Assignments
Assignments will be distributed based on individual strengths and interests. If 
a member does not complete an assignment or performs poorly, we will address it 
collaboratively and offer support to ensure accountability and improvement.

# Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums
Meeting times and locations will be decided collectively to accommodate all members. 
We will aim to schedule meetings at times that work for everyone and consider virtual 
options when necessary.

# Conversational Courtesies
We will encourage active listening and respectful dialogue by allowing everyone to share 
their thoughts without interruption. Weâ€™ll also establish norms for handling tangents and 
keeping discussions on track.

# Enforcement and Feedback
We will collectively enforce these guidelines and provide constructive feedback to each other. 
Members can share their preferences for giving and receiving feedback, ensuring that everyone 
feels comfortable and supported.

# Enforcement Responsibilites
Scrum master is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior 
and will take appropriate action in response to any behavior that is deemed inappropriate, 
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Scrum master. All complaints will be 
reviewed promptly and fairly, with respect for the privacy and security of those involved.

# Enforcement Guidelines
Correction: A private, written warning for inappropriate behavior.
Warning: A formal warning with specified consequences for continued inappropriate behavior.
Temporary Ban: A temporary exclusion from team interactions for a specified period due to serious violations.
Permanent Ban: A permanent exclusion from team interactions for repeated violations or harmful behavior.
