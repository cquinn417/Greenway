A/B Test Name: Progress Bar Size in Goal Completion Tracker
User Story Number: US4 (Goal Progress Visualization)
Metrics:
Engagement: Percentage of users who interact with the tracker.
Retention: Percentage of users who return to check their progress over a 7-day period.
Task Success: Rate of goal completion among users who view the progress bar.
Satisfaction: User satisfaction score from post-interaction surveys.
Hypothesis:
A larger progress bar will encourage users to interact with the tracker and increase their goal completion rate by providing a more visually impactful representation of progress, while a smaller, more minimal progress bar may provide an unobtrusive experience that allows users to focus on other app features.

What Problem Are We Trying to Solve? Its Impact?
Problem: Users may feel less engaged or motivated to pursue their sustainability goals if the progress bar is too small and understated or too large and obtrusive, impacting overall goal completion. Impact: Improving engagement with the progress bar could significantly boost retention, as users are more likely to return to track their goals. By optimizing the progress bar size, the app can strike the right balance between usability and motivation.

Experiment:
Audience: Weâ€™ll target 50% of the user base for the experiment, with a 50/50 split between the two progress bar sizes.
Tracking: Using Firebase Analytics, set up event tracking for:
Interactions with the progress bar (e.g., clicks, time spent viewing).
The completion rate for tracked goals.
Session frequency for users in each group.
Post-interaction satisfaction feedback (optional).
Variations:
Variation A - Large Progress Bar: A larger progress bar at the top of the goal-tracking screen, with bold percentage numbers.

Mockup: A wide, colorful bar spanning 80% of the screen width and visually prominent, with percentage text overlaid.
Variation B - Small Progress Bar: A smaller, minimal progress bar located underneath the goal text.

Mockup: A narrow, subtle progress bar beneath the goal description, with smaller, right-aligned percentage text.
